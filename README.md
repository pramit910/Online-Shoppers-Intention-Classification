# Online-Shoppers-Intention-Classification

This project is part of my academic course project IE 7300 - Statistical Learning for Engineering i.e. Machine Learning.

The goal of this project is to classify the customer's purchasing intention off a website that gathers the data pertaining to amount of time spent on each web page and also the time of the year a customer visits the website. This is essentially a binary classification problem for which various classical machine learning algorithms like Maximum Margin SVM (Soft Margin SVM with Linear Kernel), Logistic Regression (base algorithm, and with regularization L2 norm), Naive Bayes were implemented. Other than these, Deep Learning models were also implemented and the model performance was compared. Finally, the best performing model with appropriate bias-various tradeoff and performance was selected.
